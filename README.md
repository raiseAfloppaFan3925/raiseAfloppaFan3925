## About
Hello! I'm raiseAfloppaFan3925, a programmer who does random things for fun.

## Check out some of the stuff I made!
- [Nonstraightforward](https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/nonstraightforward) - An esoteric JavaScript superset designed to be as verbose as possible.
- [Mango](https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/mango) - An esolang crafted from 2010-20s internet culture.

The thing below doesn't include [Nonstraightforward](https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/nonstraightforward) because Nonstraightforward is written in Nonstraightforward, but has a lot of JavaScript which shouldn't count as most of the JavaScript in that repository is generated by the Nonstraightforward compiler.
