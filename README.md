## About
Hello! I'm raiseAfloppaFan3925, a hobbyist programmer and website/graphic designer. I like programming for fun, reinventing the wheel for no reason, and creating esoteric programming languages. My favorite esoteric languages are [pythOwO](https://github.com/virejdasani/pythOwO) and [LOLCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE).

Oh yeah and please don't check the source code of my stuff if you don't want to have a stroke...

## Currently working on
* my school work
* an esoteric programming language
* an esoteric programming language
* breathing
* thinking of a solution to my source-to-source compiler
* A recursive decent parser for a context-sensitive language

## Programming languages (in chronological order)
